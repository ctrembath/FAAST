FAAST TUBE SYSTEM
==================

The FAAST train system is a Tube system which transports passengers from station to station, charging them a set fare for each journey.
----------------------------------------------------------

The system has a number of trains within it, each train can have a varied number of carriages.
Every carriage has the capacity to hold 40 passengers.

The system is able to count the number of passengers from the moment they enter the station, to when they depart at their destinations station.

In order to travel on the FAAST train system, passengers must touch in with their FAAST rail cards. Each journey will cost Â£1. In the occasion where a passenger has insufficiant funds to gain access into the station, they will be informed when attempting to 'touch in' that they will need to top up. Every station has 'top up' machines allowing passengers to 'top up' their FAAST cards.
